# Hate Crimes Analysis
I conceptualized this personal project back in January 2020. In this project, I'll analyze hate crimes trends for Austin against the entire USA from 2017 to present. In particular, I'm focusing on the affects of hate crime against the LGBT community.  

For this project I am utilizing datasets from data.austintexas.gov, the FBI, and I may include other data sources at a later time. 

Hope y'all find it as exciting and revealing as I have and I certainly welcome any collaborators, advice, critique, etc!
