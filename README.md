# Austin Crimes Analysis

***This project is ongoing & will be updated frequently***
### Update -- 12/10/2020
I've been focusing solely on the Crime Reports dataset for a while now. Here is a list of some upcoming changes in the output:
  1. I started a series of crime prediction models, according to zip code, using the Facebook Prophet library.
  2. Because Facebook Prophet uses a ton of space, I created individual notebooks for each zip code.
  3. Be sure to utilize the nbviewer mode in order to view the forecast visualizations.

### Update -- 7/19/2020
I added a notebook to this repo, labeled "Crime Reports" in which I analyze OVERALL crime data for the Austin, TX area. The dataset for this analysis is available at https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/fdj4-gpfu. The dataset covers all reported crimes from the beginning of 2003 to the present, so it is a large dataset with over 2 million records. 


## Introduction
I conceptualized this project beginning in  January 2020. The goal is to analyze hate crimes trends for Austin, TX, from 2017 to present. In particular, I'm focusing on the effects of hate crime on the LGBT community. 

So far, I am using datasets provided by the Austin PD's publicly available databases, found at data.austintexas.gov. 

Originally, my plan was to complete this project solely in Python. The final product for the Austin portion, however, included such a small dataset that I decided to complete the analysis part in Excel. (DUCKS FOR COVER!!!) :D just kidding...I hope :P 

So far, I've reached the following findings which are included in the excel workbook: 

### **Update -- 7/10/2020**
### Presently Anti-LGBT motivated hate crimes, in Austin, TX, account for 30% of all reported incidents since 2017. 
#### By year, of the total amount of reported incidents, anti-lgbt occurrences accounted for:
##### 29.41% in 2017
##### 30% in 2018
##### 36.36% in 2019
##### 25% for the year 2020 so far

This is particularly alarming, coupled with the current Covid crisis and who knows how the pandemic will affect or stir the already disturbing trend of scape-goating against several minority communities. 

Needless to say, stay safe everyone! I hope this project is insightful and, as always, I look forward to your review and/or critique and advice.
